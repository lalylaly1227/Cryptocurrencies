# Cryptocurrencies

# Overview

This analysis consists of multiple cryptocurrencies for an investment bank which is in the process of offering crypto as another means of investment for its customers. The crypto_data.csv was retrieved from CryptoCompare. The data used for this analysis had to be cleaned and structured in a format that allowed for analysis to be completed. Unsupervised machine learning was used for this analysis. 

This assignment consists of four technical analysis deliverables.
### Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
